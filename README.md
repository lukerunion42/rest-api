# rest-api

The following project is intended to give you an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of web service and micro service concepts.  The requirements are laid out in a simple user story that intentionally leaves room for interpretation. Please use your best judgment as you decide how to best fulfill the requirements outlined. 


Requirements: 

As a user I need an online address book exposed as a REST API.  I need the data set to include the following data fields: 
First Name, Last Name, Email Address, and Phone Number

I need the api to follow standard rest semantics to support listing entries, showing a specific single entry, and adding, modifying, and deleting entries.  

The code for the address book should include regular go test files that demonstrate how to exercise all operations of the service.  

Finally I need the service to provide endpoints that can export and import the address book data in a CSV format.
